1.	How do you control for biases?
 Biases can be controlled for through various methods such as:
Randomization: Ensuring that samples are randomly selected can help mitigate biases.
Stratification: Dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups and then taking random samples from each subgroup.
Blinding: Keeping participants or analysts unaware of certain information to prevent bias.
Using diverse datasets: Incorporating data from different sources or perspectives can help identify and mitigate biases.
	2. What are confounding variables? 
Confounding variables are factors that are correlated with both the independent and dependent variables in a study, making it difficult to determine the true relationship between them. Controlling for confounding variables is important in order to accurately assess the relationship between the variables of interest.
	3. What is A/B testing? 
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method used to compare two versions (A and B) of a webpage, app, or marketing campaign to determine which one performs better. It involves dividing users into two groups and exposing each group to a different version, then analyzing the results to determine which version is more effective in achieving the desired outcome.
	4. When will you use Welch t-test?
 The Welch t-test is used when comparing the means of two independent samples and the assumption of equal variances is violated. It is more robust than the Student's t-test when the sample sizes and/or variances of the two groups are unequal.
	5. Hypothesis testing for customer service representative call time: 
Given:
Population mean (μ) = 6 minutes
Sample mean (x̄) = 6.5 minutes
Sample standard deviation (s) = 1.2 minutes
Sample size (n) = 50
Significance level (α) = 0.05
We can perform a one-sample t-test:
Null hypothesis (H0): μ = 6
Alternative hypothesis (H1): μ > 6 (claim)
Calculate the t-statistic using the formula: 𝑡=(𝑥ˉ−𝜇)/s/√n
Compare the t-statistic to the critical t-value at α = 0.05 with 49 degrees of freedom. If the t-statistic is greater than the critical t-value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is sufficient evidence to support the claim.
	6. Hypothesis testing for mean scores of two groups of students:
 Given:
Group A: 𝑥ˉ𝐴=75, 𝑠𝐴=8, nA=25
Group B: 𝑥ˉ𝐵=78, 𝑠𝐵=7, 𝑛𝐵=30
Significance level (α) = 0.05
We can perform an independent samples t-test:
Null hypothesis (H0): 𝜇𝐴=𝜇𝐵
Alternative hypothesis (H1): 𝜇𝐴≠𝜇𝐵 (two-tailed test)
Calculate the t-statistic using the formula for independent samples t-test: t = \frac{{\bar{x}_A - \bar{x}_B}}{{\sqrt{\frac{{s_A^2}}{{n_A}} + \frac{{s_B^2}}{{n_B}}}}
Compare the t-statistic to the critical t-value at α = 0.05 with degrees of freedom calculated using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation. If the t-statistic is outside the critical range, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups.
